# ChatFilterAddon

This addon scans all incomming messages in all channels you have joined, looks for LFM messages, checks if the dungeon mentioned is within your level range and puts those messages into a chat window named "LFM". 
nb: YOU need to create the chat window named LFM yourself. Also make sure you have joined World and LookingForMore channels in another window (which does not need to be in front)

1: put cfa folder in addon folder

2: Create a new chat window named "LFM" - the addon outputs everything here

3: Join "world, LookingForMore" etc in a hidden chat window

4: Enjoy a cleaner channel without spam for dungeons you can't join :)
