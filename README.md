# ChatFilterAddon

This addon scans all incomming messages in all channels you have joined, looks for LFM messages, checks if the dungeon mentioned is within your level range and puts those messages into a chat window named "LFM". 
nb: YOU need to create the chat window named LFM yourself. Also make sure you have joined World and LookingForMore channels in another window (which does not need to be in front)

1: Install this addon like you would any other

2: Create a new chat window named "LFM". The name of the chat window is important and needs to be EXACTLY "LFM", as the addon always looks for a windows named "LFM". 

3: Join "world, LookingForMore" etc in a hidden chat window

4: Enjoy a cleaner channel without spam for dungeons you can't join :)


Troubleshooting:

If it doesn't seem to be working

A) Make sure you have joined channels where people ask for dungeons

B) Make sure you have made a chat windows named "LFM"

C) Make sure you have joined relevant channels like "world" and "LookingForMore". You can go into the settings and un-check them, the addon works as long as you have joined them, and not left
